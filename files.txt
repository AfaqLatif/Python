1. read()          = read all data in a file
2. write()         = write data in a file (if a file is already has some content in it and we open 
                                            that file in write mode and also write some content in 
                                            it then the already written content is replaced by the new content)

3. readline()      = read 1 line in a file

f=open("abc.txt")
here f is file handler or file pointer
4. for x in f:     = it read all lines in a file one by one

f=open("abc.txt")
data=f.read()
5. for x in data:  = it read all data in a file and print the data as characters one by one

6.readlines()      = it read all lines in a file and store them in a list

7.append()         = it adds content in existed file
e.g, f=opne("abc.txt","a")

8.PLUS Mode :
    +              = it opens the file in read and write mode
    e.g, f=opne("abc.txt","r+")
    data=f.read()
    f.write("some content....")
